# ICS4U CPT - Data Interaction and Visualization - Lydia He
[Link to data set](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/population-growth-the-annual-change-of-the-population)

The data modelled in this CPT is representative of the annual changes in world population. Growth is determined by population change, whether positive or negative. With user interaction, data for prospected population growth for years after 2023 can also be modelled. Changes in population are accompanied by a variety of causes and therefore results, and it is important to visualize these changes. Within the next 100 years, this data predicts world population will stop rising and instead begin decreasing.
